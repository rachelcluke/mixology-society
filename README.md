# UI / Design Choices

## Moodboard

One of the first milestones of this project was to create a moodboard to help envision the overall house style of the webiite and ensure that all of the sections and elements are cohesive. The software I used to create the moodboard for this website is [Mila Note](https://milanote.com/ "Mila Note").
Below, is the moodboard:

## Fonts

In order to move away from the basic fonts available, I have used
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Glory](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Glory "Glory font") as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look. To make the navigation bar stand out form the text, I decided to use [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter "Inter font"). This font is complimentary to the Glory font, and will help be distinctive as navigation links in the header.

## Icons

I will use some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will be used in the About Us Section and also the social media links in the footer. All icons used will be styled and in keeping with the appearance of the website.

## Colours

The colour scheme of the website is inspired by the moodboard (previously depicted). I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/ "coolers") to retrieve the desired colour codes and generate the colour palette.

Below, is the color palette:

## Breakpoints

As a starting point, I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Class Infix | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | none        | <576px     |
| small       | sm          | => 576px   |
| medium      | md          | => 768px   |
| large       | lg          | => 992px   |
| x-large     | xl          | => 1200px  |

## Wireframes

I have used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamiq") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. The website is a one-pager, that is split up into 3 sections. This gets the user through the content and quickly to the contact form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:

[Home Section - Desktop Wireframe](assets/wireframes/1-home-desktop-wireframe.png "home desktop wireframe")

[Home Section - Phone Wireframe](assets/wireframes/1-home-phone-wireframe.png "home phone wireframe")

[About Section - Desktop Wireframe](assets/wireframes/2-about-desktop-wireframe.png "about desktop wireframe")

[About Section - Phone Wireframe](assets/wireframes/2-about-phone-wireframe.png "about phone wireframe")

[Sign Up Section - Desktop Wireframe](assets/wireframes/3-signup-desktop-wireframe.png "signup desktop wireframe")

[Sign Up Section - Phone Wireframe](assets/wireframes/3-signup-phone-wireframe.png "signup phone wireframe")
